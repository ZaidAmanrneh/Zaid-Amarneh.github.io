                    Greetings! I'm Zaid Amarneh, an 18-year-old student currently immersed in the world of Industrial Engineering at the German Jordanian University. 
                    My passion lies in aiding others and enhancing their lives.
                <br><br>
                With a well-rounded background in Google Ads, public speaking, 
                programming, and offering valuable advice, I bring a diverse skill set to the table. 
                I had the privilege of attending an MIT course in Amman, Jordan, focusing on Python language and web development.
                <br><br>
                This transformative experience has not only deepened my love for technology and creative problem-solving but has also fueled my excitement to continue my educational journey. 
                I look forward to exploring new horizons and opportunities in the dynamic realm of Industrial Engineering.
